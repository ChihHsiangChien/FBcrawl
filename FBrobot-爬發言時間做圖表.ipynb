      "Mark Zuckerberg7月24日 · We've formally reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission about privacy. We've agreed to pay a historic fine, but even more important, we're going to make some major structural changes to how we build products and run this company. We have a responsibility to protect people's privacy. We already work hard to live up to this responsibility, but now we're going to set a completely new standard for our industry.  As part of this settlement, we're bringing our privacy⋯⋯ controls more in line with our financial controls under the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. Our executives, including me, will have to certify that all of the work we oversee meets our privacy commitments. Just as we have an audit committee of our board to oversee our financial controls, we’ll set up a new privacy committee of our board that will oversee our privacy program. We've also asked one of our most experienced product leaders to take on the role of Chief Privacy Officer for Products. To implement this, we’ll have to review our technical systems to document any privacy risks and how we're handling them. Going forward, when we ship a new feature that uses data, or modify an existing feature to use data in new ways, we’ll have to document any risks and the steps we're taking to mitigate them. We expect it will take hundreds of engineers and more than a thousand people across our company to do this important work. And we expect it will take longer to build new products following this process going forward. Overall, these changes go beyond anything required under US law today. The reason I support them is that I believe they will reduce the number of mistakes we make and help us deliver stronger privacy protections for everyone. As we build our privacy-focused vision for the future of social networking that I outlined earlier this year, it's critical we get this right. The next focus for our company is to build privacy protections as strong as the best services we provide. I'm committed to doing this well and delivering the best private social platform for our community. 更多翻譯年糕\n",

      "Mark Zuckerberg7月11日 · Congrats to our team on this major step forward building an AI that can beat multiple pros at poker! Unlike Go or Chess, most of the biggest challenges we face -- like fighting spammers or foreign interference -- require defeating multiple adversaries at once in environments where we have imperfect information about their resources or what they're doing. Poker is a better approximation of these challenges, and building an AI that can beat the best in the world is an important technological milestone.翻譯年糕關於這個網站ai.facebook.comFacebook, Carnegie Mellon build first AI that beats pros in 6-player pokerFacebook AI and Carnegie Mellon researchers have built Pluribus, the first AI bot to beat top pros in six-player Texas Hold’em poker.\n",

      "Mark Zuckerberg6月27日 · My next discussion on the future of technology and society is focused on freedom of expression and governance.  I'm joined by Jenny Martinez, the Dean of Stanford Law School, and Noah Feldman, a Professor at Harvard Law. They're both experts in constitutional law, and Noah is also an advisor to Facebook helping us define the independent oversight board where people will be able to appeal our content decisions. The idea is to create a separation of powers so that while Faceboo⋯⋯k is responsible for enforcing our policies, we aren't in the position to make so many decisions about speech on our own. This board will be tasked with upholding the principle of free expression while ensuring we keep our community safe. This morning we also released a report with all the feedback we've gotten from experts about how to best set up this board based on almost 30 workshops we've hosted around the world. It also covers many of the questions asked in our live discussion, including how the board members should be selected to ensure independence, what the scope of their decision-making should be, the importance of publishing their deliberations, and more. You can check out the full report here: https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/…/oversight-board-… This is a major experiment in governance, and if it's successful, this board could become an important part of how online expression and communities work going forward. This is a nuanced topic and I'm grateful to Jenny and Noah for their input, as well as everyone who participated in these workshops and shared their thoughts on how to get this right. 更多翻譯年糕播放-1:06:33其他視覺設定進入浮動視窗模式點擊放大靜音點擊可展開Mark Zuckerbergtriangle-downtriangle-upshare分享你好像無法播放這段影片。如果是的話，請重新啟動瀏覽器。關閉由 Mark Zuckerberg 張貼692,791 次觀看與朋友或社團一同觀賞影片舉辦影片趴\n",

      "Mark Zuckerberg5月10日 · I just met with President Emmanuel Macron in Paris to discuss new rules and regulations for the internet. We both believe governments should take a more active role around important issues like balancing expression and safety, privacy and data portability, and preventing election interference -- reflecting their own traditions of free speech.  Last year we invited French government officials to look at how we manage harmful content on our platforms. Our systems now proactivel⋯⋯y identify 65% of the hate speech we take down before it’s even reported -- up from 24% a year ago. But there are nuanced decisions to make here, such as how we should handle content that isn’t illegal but might cause harm. This is an area where I believe companies should not make these decisions by themselves and there should be a public process with democratically elected governments.  Today the French government shared their recommendations for a new model that sets guidelines around what’s considered harmful. This would create a more consistent approach across the industry and ensure companies are held accountable for enforcing our standards against this content. While I am sure we won’t agree on everything, it’s important to get this right -- people use lots of different online services and the internet should be one platform that everyone can access on the same terms. This is our first official collaboration on regulation with a government, and we’re hopeful this process could work for other countries. Thank you to President Macron for hosting us and for your leadership on these important issues. 更多翻譯年糕\n",
      "Mark Zuckerberg4月30日 · Today at F8, I talked about how we're starting to build out a privacy-focused social platform. For the last 15 years, we've built Facebook and Instagram into digital equivalents of the town square, where you can interact with lots of people at once. Now we're focused on building the digital equivalent of the living room, where you can interact in all the ways you'd want privately -- from messaging and stories to secure payments and more. To bring this vision to life, we're bu⋯⋯ilding Messenger and WhatsApp into platforms for all kinds of private interactions and working on making end-to-end encryption the default for both. We've redesigned Facebook to make communities as central as friends. We've added new ways to buy things securely on Instagram. Augmented and virtual reality also create more personal and intimate experiences -- so we’re bringing WhatsApp to Portal, adding end-to-end encryption for all calls, and launching Portal internationally. And I'm very excited that this year we're shipping Oculus Rift S and Oculus Quest, the headset that gives you full freedom of movement with no cables. As we build more of our services around this privacy vision, we're also changing how we run our company. We're committed to consulting with experts on the major tradeoffs and social issues to find the best path forward, taking a more active role in making sure developers use our tools in good ways, and building out the technical infrastructure to support this vision. This is going to take time and we don't have all the answers yet, but we're focused on getting this right and doing it openly. I’m looking forward to sharing more with you as we continue on this journey to build a private social platform. 更多翻譯年糕\n",

      "Mark Zuckerberg4月27日 · Being a mom is hard, and since we've had kids Priscilla has had a hard time sleeping through the night. She'll wake up and check the time on her phone to see if the kids might wake up soon, but then knowing the time stresses her out and she can't fall back asleep. So I worked on building her what I call the \"sleep box\". It sits on her nightstand, and between the hours of 6-7am it emits a very faint light -- visible enough that if she sees it she'll know it's an okay time for ⋯⋯one of us to get the kids, but faint enough that the light won't wake her up if she's still sleeping. And since it doesn't show the time, if she wakes up in the middle of the night, she knows to just go back to sleep without having to worry about what time it is. So far this has worked better than I expected and she can now sleep through the night.  As an engineer, building a device to help my partner sleep better is one of the best ways I can think of to express my love and gratitude. A bunch of my friends have told me they'd want something like this, so I'm putting this out there in case another entrepreneur wants to run with this and build sleep boxes for more people! 更多翻譯年糕\n",
